This is an EXPERIMENTAL network installer for
BunsenLabs Linux on Debian Stretch.

It will use the BunsenLabs experimental helium Apt repository
to download and install necessary packages,
along with packages from the Debian repositories,
and do any other necessary configuration.

As this is intended only for development and testing at the moment,
do not use this "helium-dev" version of the installer for
any systems where breakage would be a problem!
