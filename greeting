This is an experimental network installer for
BunsenLabs Linux on cli Debian Trixie,
in a Wayland environment using the labwc compositor.

It will use the BunsenLabs Carbon repository
and micko01's experimental repository
to download and install necessary packages,
along with packages from the Debian repositories,
and do any other necessary configuration.

This is still very much a Work In Progress, so
please be ready to deal with any bugs that might show up!
